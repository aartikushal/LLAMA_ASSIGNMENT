🦙 LLaMA Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (LLAMA.ipynb) that demonstrates how to run and interact with the LLaMA language model.
It provides a simple interface to test prompt–response generation and experiment with model parameters.

📌 Features

Run LLaMA model inference in a Jupyter Notebook.

Supports configurable parameters such as temperature, top_p, and max_tokens.

Simple chatbot-like experience inside the notebook.

Easily extendable for custom use cases (fine-tuning, evaluation, experimentation).

📂 Repository Structure
├── LLAMA.ipynb        # Main notebook with code and examples
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies (to be generated if not present)
├── README.md          # Project documentation
└── models/            # Place your LLaMA model weights/configs here (not included)

🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/llama-notebook.git
cd llama-notebook

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


If requirements.txt is not included, install Jupyter and Hugging Face libraries manually:

pip install jupyter transformers accelerate torch

⚙️ Usage

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Open LLAMA.ipynb.

Follow the notebook cells to load the model and start interacting.

📊 Example
prompt = "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."
response = model.generate(prompt)
print(response)


Output:

Quantum computing uses special properties of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers cannot...

📦 Deployment Options

Run locally on CPU/GPU.

Use Google Colab by uploading LLAMA.ipynb.

Adapt code to deploy via Gradio/Streamlit for a web-based chatbot.
